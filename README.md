# Basic Random Color Palette Generator

This is a personal, solo project for generating **random color palettes**! ðŸŽ‰

This is very basic, but my first experience with API's, so I've learned quite a bit about them in the process!

## Current Features

- **Random color palette generation**, reflected in the color cards and the background.

- **You can copy the HEX codes** with a right click.
- **Responsive**

## Overview

This is made using CSS Grid, vanilla JS, and the [Color Names API](https://github.com/meodai/color-names).

I've choosen this API library as it is public, open-source, and for its huge library of color names, and the possibility of not having duplicates. I've tested a few other APIs in the development, but I found this one to be the best one for what I was trying to accomplish.

I was hugely inspired by Pantone's design, and clay elements.

## Future Improvements

There's a lot of room for improvement in this project. Some of potential future implementations that I have in mind:

- [ ] Toggle between HEX, RGB and HSL;
- [ ] Change the box background according to the color scheme;
- [ ] Change the number of generated colors;

## Changelog

- 1.0 - Initial commit.
